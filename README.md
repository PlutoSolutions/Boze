# [ info ]

OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYY SCIENCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Is this a new PRODUCT by KONAS DEVELOPERS? OHHHHHHHH MYYYYYY GOOOOOOOOD I FUCKING LOVE KONAS SO MUCH YOU GUYS WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKKKK I GOTTA BUY IT ON DAY ONE

So the release of Boze was shit. People that bought the cheat on day one had to wait two days afterwards until the devs decided to stop masturbating to cub pornography and finally migrated to a new server for no real reason.

But the cheat itself is surprisingly good, even though it's just because it was made for Minecraft versions higher than 1.12.2, and all other cheats (meteor/bleachhack/jex/etc) are very bad. Some settings in Boze modules look like module settings in other clients (such as future and earthhack), but who cares if the competition is shit? That's right, nobody cares and nobody should care. If it works it works.

# [ how-to ]

Since Boze was made for Minecraft 1.19.2, you need Java 17 or higher. Find it yourself somewhere online.

</div>

1. Download the Fabric installer from [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/), open it and choose Minecraft 1.19.2 and Fabric 0.14.11 ([pic](https://crystalpvp.ru/boze/install.png))
0. Download bozecrack.zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/Boze/releases) and extract everything into your .minecraft folder
0. Start the game (with Fabric)
